Data and Software Availability
Data and software used in this work are all available. The geometric coordinate files of the 12 single-atom catalysts under investigation are provided in the directory Data source/1.Geometric structure/. The structures of the TOF-determining state (TDTS) and TOF-determining intermediate (TDI) on these catalysts are accessible in Data source/2.TDI&TDTS/. All density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP 5.4.4), which is retrievable via https://www.vasp.at/. The VTST 3.2 code can be accessed at https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/vtsttools/.

The projected density of states (PDOS), charge density difference (CDD) and crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) data for the Rh- and Ir-based catalysts under study are provided in Data sources/3.PDOS/, Data sources/4.CDD and COHP/, respectively. The catalyst structures were visualized using BIOVIA Materials Studio 8.0 (available at https://www.3ds.com/products/biovia/materials-studio) and VESTA 3.90.5a (obtainable from https://www.jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/download.html). Charge transfer analyses were conducted using the Bader 1.04 code, which can be accessed at https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/henkelman/code/bader/. The integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) values for the transition metal-oxygen (TM-O) bonds were computed using the LOBSTER 4.0.0 code, accessible via http://www.cohp.de/.
